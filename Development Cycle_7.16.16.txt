Development Cycle

Updates 7.16.16
-Merged new D2DGraphics class and architecture reshuffling changes into master.
-We will both be working on this master version of the framework from now on.

TODO:
Greg
-Properly implement Texture class in Framework
1) Add a Clone of Model.h/cpp - "ModelTextured.h/cpp"
2) Successfully implement basic texturing on a single triangle
3) Successfully implement mapping of this texture onto new 
    3DPrimitive objects in framework
-Add a new class "Direction" that uses 3D vectors to determine facing direction
of an object, basic directional motion, collision detection (?); start to work out unit 
vector functionality in framework

Josh
-Start working on procedural level generation
Projected process from our last discussion:
1) Start w a map filled with non-passable tiles (cars).
Randomly "burrow through" to clear a path to the exit.
2) After clearing the path, use cellular automata concept to test
each cleared cell for game criteria.
3) Also test each nonpassable cell w/ cellular automata concept
for adherence to game principles (for example, there would have to
be at least two cells adjacent to each nonpassable cell, on opposite sides
to allow the player to get in and push the object into the opposite open space.
4) After an appropriate map has been generated, replace the nonpassable
cells with cars. Also take into account single cells (cars occupy two cells
each). 
*Possibly add "motorcycles" that only occupy one cell, or just free the
single cells.
5) Further AI testing to push cars into place in such a way that the exit
is blocked, but there is at least way to push the cars out of the way
and clear a path to win.
